# Verilog Code Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the Verilog Code Challenge, completed as part of **KVLSI Kohort 2**.

Each folder represents a day's challenge, showcasing various digital design concepts using Verilog HDL.

## About

The goal of this challenge is to strengthen fundamentals in hardware description and design, covering topics like combinational and sequential circuits, FSMs, and more.
